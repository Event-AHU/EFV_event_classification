## Abstract 
Recognizing target objects using an event-based camera draws more and more attention in recent years. Existing works usually represent the event streams into point-cloud, voxel, image, etc, and learn the feature representations using various deep neural networks. Their final results may be limited by the following factors: monotonous modal expressions and the design of the network structure. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes a novel dual-stream framework for event representation, extraction, and fusion. This framework simultaneously models two common representations: event images and event voxels. By utilizing Transformer and Structured Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures, spatial information and three-dimensional stereo information can be learned separately. Additionally, a bottleneck Transformer is introduced to facilitate the fusion of the dual-stream information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely used event-based classification datasets.
